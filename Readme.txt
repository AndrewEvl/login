Hello! My name is Andrew! I present my implementation of your test task.

After extracting the job from the archive, open it using your IDE through the pom.xml file. Next you must run Start_SQL.sql to deploy the database. All the dependencies needed for the correct operation of the program should automatically download and install. The application is ready to go!

In the application one entity is used. There has methods for working with the database:
- save (collects a new user in the database.) Accepts the User entity)
- search by ID (searches for a unique user ID. Accepts Long id)
- delete (deletes the entry from the database by the entity. Accepts the User entity)
- delete by ID (deletes the entry by the ID. Accepts the Long id)

I took about 5 hours to complete the task.

Have a good day!
